While employed at Cosairus, I created an application for reviewing HIPAA release of information
requests. The application used a Vue frontend and ASP.NET Core backend. The application was
developed almost entirely solo.

Users could easily search for requests by organization. They could also view requests in order of
priority.

Documents and information were shown side-by-side in an adjustable two-pane viewer. Requests could
be approved and completed, or rejected.

The application was also meant to be tied to the [assessment AI](assessment.md) and display its
results, allowing users to provide feedback and improve future iterations of the AI model.
